# Modules app example

It is a new version of app from [this](https://myblog96921.gatsbyjs.io/simple-practical-project) post. This new version is different from the previous one in that here I use JS modules. Generally I have written "mini series
" of three posts about modules in JS, and this project is used as an example in the last post of this series.
